INTRO
-----

sip.js is a SIP stack for node.js. It implements tranaction and transport layers as described in RFC3261. 

This fork fixes a few bugs, and adds WebSocket transport (giving us 'tcp', 'udp', and 'ws').
It also uses a single UDP socket per transport instead of creating one per client dialog.

Things are a bit messy. Sorry!
